torrent-sites
=============

Using the torrent network to host websites

This project is to explore the possibility of hosting websites in an entirely decentralized way. Hosted by people visiting the website.

I am very excited as I think its not far off now.

Let's talk about it here: https://github.com/marcus7777/torrent-sites/issues

What could torrent sites be used for?
* A free hard to block hosting platform for all by all.
* A place for developers to work on projects that run locally and automatically sync with each other.

Let name it "outtaSite". 

Things to add:
* A way to display a page through torrent (e.g. [webtorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent))
* A way to display a website/app with no certral server.
  * Using [Service Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-service-workers-20141118/)
* A nice way edit the local storage. (Fork me I'm Yours)
* A way to authentication people and list people as okay to propagate.
  * Update from ...
  * Review?
  * Apply? Always Yes No Never
* A way of listing public site for people without a domain name.
